	  If you say Y to this option, support will be included for 
	  the Sunwave's fingerprint sensor. This driver supports 
	  both REE and TEE. If in REE, CONFIG_SPI_SPIDEV must be set 
	  to use the standard 'spidev' driver.
	
	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called 'sunwave_fp'.
